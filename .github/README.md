GitHub applies only its documented fallback community files automatically. Agent instructions, relationship files, and reusable workflows are **not copied into sibling repositories**; repositories that need local enforcement must carry their own lowercase `agents.md` and explicitly call or copy the provided workflow.

`repository-relationships.json` is generated from GitHub owner membership plus reviewed declarations in `repository-relationships.manual.json`. It is public-safe: private repository names are omitted. The complete graph is synchronized separately to the approved private project registry.

## Safety baseline

Changes are pull-request driven. Contributors and agents must preserve concurrent work, avoid destructive Git operations, resolve conflicts semantically with full history and cross-repository context, validate affected contracts, and never claim a remote action completed without authoritative evidence.

Generated baseline version: `2026-08-04`.
